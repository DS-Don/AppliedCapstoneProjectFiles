# AppliedCapstoneProjectFiles
This repository contains code that I wrote as part of a capstone project for a Data Science certificate from IBM
The aim of the project was to collect SpaceX data in order to utilise it in building a predictive model
using an API or to scrap it from a webiste
Perform EDA on the data, by visualizing feature relationships
Wrangle the data using sql
Develop a predictive model for predicting success of new rocket launches
